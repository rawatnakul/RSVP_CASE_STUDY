# SQL_RSVP_CASE_STUDY
In this study, I have used SQL to analyze imdb dataset for RSVP movies which is looking forward to producing a movie for a global audience.
# Problem Statement
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan its every move analytically based on data and has approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyze the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyze the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights.
